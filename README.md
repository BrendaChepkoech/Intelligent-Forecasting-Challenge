# Overview

Contraceptive utilization is the practice that helps individuals or couples avoid unwanted pregnancy. Beyond preventing unwanted pregnancy, contraceptive access is vital to safe motherhood and prosperous communities.  

Access to contraceptives enables individuals/couples to determine when they want to begin having children, how far apart they want their children to be and when to stop having children. It also slows unsustainable  population growth. This is important because overpopulation puts pressure on the economy affecting services being offered to citizens. 

Contraceptive methods range from The condom, The oral contraceptive pill, Intrauterine Device (IUD), The Contraceptive Implant, The Contraceptive Injection, Emergency Contraception Pill (The ‘Morning After’ Pill), Contraceptive Ring, Diaphragm to Sterilization.

 # Objectives
 
 USAID  works with local health care authorities and partners to support voluntary family planning and reproductive health programs in nearly 40 countries across the globe. This includes ensuring contraceptives are available and accessible to people who need them. 
 
West African countries are poised for significant change in family planning behaviors.
Particularly, findings from the Family planning demand analysis highlighted that based on the unmet demand for Family Planning (FP) alone, there are more than 2 million potential new contraceptive users in Cote d’Ivoire.

## Main Objective

The Main goal of this project is  to therefore build  a model that  predicts consumption for 11 contraceptives across 156 health service delivery sites in the public sector health system in Côte d’Ivoire. The predictions are to be made monthly from October to December 2019.

## The Specific objectives include:

1. Calculating Monthly and Annually  Average stock distributed.

2. Identifying the distribution of contraceptives in the different regions.

3. Comparing  Stock received and distributed in the different site codes.

4. Identifying the number of delivery sites and Products.
